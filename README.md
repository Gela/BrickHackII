# FaceAuth
User authentication via facial recognition using the Face API from the Oxfird Project at Microsoft, built in 20 hours during BrickHack II [Spring 2016] 

This project is a web app implemented using JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, Ajax, and JQuery. We have used Microsoft's Face REST API (Project Oxford) 
in order to do the facial recognition and authentication. Additionally, to enable using the webcam within the user's browser, we are utilizing WebCamJs which is an open source library.

#Setup
You'll need to be running a local server (XAMPP is a great choice). You will need to set up a server to store the images and return a URL which you can then pass onto the API.
If you are using Google Chrome and experience any issues opening the webcam, try another browser (Firefox seems to be the most reliable).
